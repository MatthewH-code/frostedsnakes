								<h2>Cyrosphere Quick Facts</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The cryosphere encompasses all areas on Earth that contain frozen water. This includes permafrost, glaciers, and snow accumulation. The cryosphere gets its name from the Greek word for cold, “krios,” and is a vital component of the Earth’s climate. It is important for people to understand the cryosphere so we can better protect the Earth.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The cryosphere is comprised of all the place on Earth were water is in its solid form. This includes not only the polar regions around the North and South Poles, but any location on Earth with snow and ice. </p>

								<h4>The Artic</h4>
								<p>The Arctic refers to the region surrounding the North Pole. The pole itself is covered by the Arctic Ocean, in which sea ice grows and shrink according to the seasons. The Arctic Ocean is ringed by frozen ground and permafrost covered by glaciers, snow, and ice. Greenland is part of the Arctic cryosphere. </p>

								<h4>Antarctica</h4>
								<p>Antarctica, which means opposite Arctic, is a continent covered in a humongous ice sheet that sometimes breaks and sends floating ice shelves and icebergs into the ocean.</p>

								<h4>Snow</h4>
								<p>When water in clouds gets below 32° Fahrenheit or 0° Celsius it condenses directly into ice without going into a liquid, forming an ice crystal. This crystal then falls to Earth as snow. Snow can fall in several forms, including snowflakes, which are clusters of ice crystals and snow pellets, which are cloud particles that collided with ice crystals to form a soft, crumbly, partly liquid particle. Other forms of frozen precipitation are sleet and hail.</p>

								<h4>Ice</h4>
								<p>Ice is formed when the temperature drops below the freezing point and liquid water becomes a tightly bonded substance. Ice exists all over the world, especially in high latitudes or elevations, and is a key ingredient in glaciers, sea ice, ice shelves, icebergs, and frozen ground.</p>

								<h4>Sea Ice</h4>
								<p>Sea ice is frozen ocean water only found in remote polar oceans. It is unique because it forms, grows, and melts in the oceans rather than originating on land. About 15% of the world’s oceans are covered by sea ice during part of the year.</p>

								<h4>Glaciers</h4>
								<p>Glaciers are large masses of ice that form and move on land. They form over many seasons of snowfall and cover 10% of the world’s land. They also contain 75% of the world’s fresh water. Glaciers are unique because of their ability to move and shape the landscape over many centuries.</p>

								<h4>Ice Shelves and Icebergs</h4>
								<p>Where ice sheets and glaciers move out into the ocean, they form platforms of ice called ice shelves. These ice shelves are permanent floating sheets of ice that connect to a landmass. Icebergs are large chunks of ice that have broken off from glaciers and ice shelves and drift in the oceans. They travel with ocean currents and can be dangerous to ships in the North Atlantic and the Antarctic Ocean. Small icebergs are called bergy bits.</p>

								<h4>Frozen Ground</h4>
								<p>Frozen ground is when the water inside the ground freezes. In some areas, the ground freezes and thaws seasonally, and in others it is frozen year-round. If ground stays frozen for at least two years in a row, it is called permafrost.</p>
